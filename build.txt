to generate verilog HDL code, run the following command line in wsl:

> sbt "runMain vexriscv.aradex.VpSocVerilog"

Resulting verilog code is written to:
.\temp\VpSoc



To generate VHDL, use this command (hex files must be located in main directory):

> sbt "runMain vexriscv.aradex.VpSocVhdl_vp"
